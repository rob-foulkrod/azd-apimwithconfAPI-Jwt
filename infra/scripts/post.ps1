.SYNOPSIS
    Azure AD (Entra) App Registration Cleanup for API Management JWT Authentication

.PREREQUISITES
    - Azure CLI installed and authenticated with sufficient permissions:
      * Application.ReadWrite.All (to delete app registrations)
      * Directory.ReadWrite.All (to read tenant information)
    - AZD (Azure Developer CLI) initialized with environment variables set

.DESCRIPTION
    This post-down script automates the cleanup of Azure AD (Entra) App Registration
    that was created during the pre-deployment phase. It removes the app registration
    and cleans up AZD environment variables to ensure a complete teardown.

.TECHNIQUES AND PATTERNS USED

    1. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE INTEGRATION
       - Reads configuration from AZD environment variables set during pre-deployment
       - Uses CONF_REG_OBJECTID and CONF_REG_AUD for app identification
       - Graceful handling when environment variables are missing

    2. IDEMPOTENT CLEANUP PATTERN
       - Checks if app registration exists before attempting deletion
       - Supports re-running the script without errors
       - Handles "already deleted" scenarios gracefully

    3. COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP
       - Removes the Azure AD app registration
       - Clears all related AZD environment variables
       - Ensures no orphaned configuration remains


.INPUTS
    AZD Environment Variables (if available):
    - CONF_REG_OBJECTID: App registration object ID
    - CONF_REG_AUD: Application ID URI
    - CONF_REG_TENANTID: Azure AD tenant ID
    - CONF_REG_SCOPE: OAuth2 scope name

.EXAMPLE
    .\post.ps1

.NOTES
    This script is designed to run as an AZD post-down hook (infra/scripts/post.ps1)
    and complements the pre-deployment setup script (pre.ps1).
